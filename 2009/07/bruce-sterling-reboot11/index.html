    <p>I’ve run the <a href="http://video.reboot.dk/video/486788/bruce-sterling-reboot-11">Bruce Sterling’ reboot <span class="numbers">11</span> closing talk</a>, through <a href="http://www.replay.ethz.ch/">replay</a>, that uses <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/">sphinx<span class="numbers">4</span></a> speech recognition engine, see below what Bruce said, more or less… (I hope the lines are in order, the process was multithreaded, I sorted them by thread number)</p>
<p>Try to simultaneously <a href="http://video.reboot.dk/video/486788/bruce-sterling-reboot-11">watch the video</a> while trying to understand why you get funny things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>atemporality = and the timber rally, and a temper relative</li>
<li>flickr’s = slickers</li>
<li>eleven reboots = a laminar a bid its</li>
<li>number one, the bed = number one up dead, etc.</li>

<p>[transcript follows]</p>
<p>we’re ready for that removed those things that said<br /> ah this year or a teacher in a prison blues very honored and very pleased with it<br /> came on the way here to share ah it’s both about action and that what a group of people like us to do<br /> so bruce dilated<br /> i e e t<br /> so i face rather debtor<br /> arthritis it thomason is nordic dickson action and i’d say that now having been here two days that’s about when i<br /> specter and and i was very gratifying<br /> a case i i did that allot two days that night on the last speech in a bed of this kind to possibly be<br /> to shore bob there will be no graphics not doesn’t your indyk graphic<br /> so i would like to do like i do all four ah so the graphic health studies and the timber rally<br /> is like some graphics they did earlier you’re like a graphics guys you gotta have graphics during a speech<br /> the guy might flickers said studies and a temper relative i really need some help<br /> but this flickers that i know you’re not paying attention by graphics anyway<br /> you’re a bright people easily distracted go on to bristling slickers that like<br /> first that is an attempt relative you can help me out there on a cave sellout got a lot<br /> straight about a year that well you know a really matches up to its billing that’s a red dog<br /> what’s not so great about a year event obviously you had eleven rebounds<br /> a laminar a bid its people when they have a stable flight tunnel system<br /> i don’t think a guy gal line in your lifetime<br /> i i like remember that grand narrative by grand narrative like we had last year and i like that big break<br /> through interpretive grand narrative well i got another grand air<br /> we like rebut it the other narrative about another paradigm but even more to stabilize saying<br /> and suffer said that last year as paradigm of<br /> that’s problematic action not words okay i’m a novelist you know a bunch of words that is a very<br /> tiresome action issue for being<br /> actually had to deliver a bunch of words like to know a thousand are out and helps it that makes some sense<br /> graf future narratives i do a lot of that i gave you want on not just binary but i’m a good entire decade decide<br /> to to do to china stretch out a little about tell you what next decade<br /> looks and feels like a house or culture or the first lap to tell your story has annoyed you guys are obsolete big and if some stories about<br /> my profession summit tell you an anecdote about fi out<br /> after i had a this guy and to read off to to design for fidel<br /> so i said that’s a vanity to decipher fi i was there and he was explaining that design philosophy of the yacht<br /> i demand out of freon is actually doing pretty well lately they basically rack<br /> turin monday went broke that that was twenty years ago and now they’ve like come up with a better design skiing<br /> now what’s it about well it’s about duffy yacht five hundred which is it all began for fear audits is like cute little calmer and<br /> kind of a lot that if people would your generation and really kind of cell and like hot cakes<br /> and f. b. i. made so much money off it as they tried to buy general motors europe it<br /> quite make it before the bankruptcy but they didn’t buy chrysler<br /> so you know the outs made enough money off of a car that i like moving into detroit which is like the american tourette<br /> several hundred times worse off so i are are are friendly out just a design from mom<br /> from from the yacht was addressing an audience about this size<br /> and he was explaining why this car was such a hit and well in all its fifty years all<br /> and that’s why it’s so contemporary edson alton there will be up<br /> mitts askew amorphous just the same picture of the old pianist us<br /> china put back into out novel but not exactly futuristic but at least bestselling<br /> our package it so powerfully well designed very popular<br /> contemporary car bridges over now and also fifty years all<br /> so i was here a jury has about this so i asked him a noise that out by i. after the public is like<br /> but take him at the fee out five hundred is a big success for you know as i can even bigger success and the original b. i. five hundred<br /> where do you plan to go from here are the most the future of the yacht five hundred are you going to release<br /> the next car that came after the few got five hundred historically<br /> because there was a car that came back to the fee out five hundred and presumably it was an improvement<br /> there were the fiato five hundred great defender of live this old are you going to revive the next car that came after that<br /> are you said now don’t get a business was unimportant issue when they spot a lot of time thinking about that<br /> a what they were doing was they had introduced a fee on five hundred<br /> and they were watching the demographic groups who had picked up on the yacht five hundred and they were looking at post consumer alteration<br /> but duffy yacht five hundred of them they were going to professionalize that<br /> make another words are like young soccer hooligan tough guys who said that toughed out there for ya five hundred<br /> special hubcaps and so forth racing stripes to their going to do that<br /> and i was like the women’s group are like us to outline a cousin was today we’re doing that cuter version and the senate now<br /> animate dangling tolls on the rear view mirror and you know maybe some hot plate for allies<br /> i think that they were tracking down and there can adopt out to a mother wears irvine and moonves yeah five hundred into emergent<br /> democratic groups this was the way for work<br /> they were looking for a merchant consumer groups and they were going to move the car into their social space<br /> year by year<br /> i i this is a really clever idea and i thought<br /> i’m in a society it’s going to do a lot of this and i thought this really is a terrible and scary paradigm<br /> but the future because it’s very difficult for us to construe that kind of activity<br /> as progress everybody’d for two hundred years<br /> almost as the twelve hundreds of now and what progress means that no enemies to be progressive and they know what it means to<br /> the futuristic you get more scientific knowledge<br /> you create more tools to make more jobs you master in nature you get more power<br /> schieffer our new struggle for a better life for your children<br /> you’re looking for health prosperity material security shelter<br /> bigger faster stronger or no and more everybody knows that’s progress that’s not<br /> what we’re gonna get the actual objective situation looks more like this<br /> no money scarcity financial collapse collapse states<br /> general for character’s and energy prices low intensity global warfare and are rapidly advancing climate<br /> crisis<br /> that’s the that’s the situation on the ground now and people ask where did the future does or the suburbs<br /> glamorous versions of the future why we loved it were deliberately choosing a move away from that and and to a non twentieth century<br /> spence murmured in a situation with generation x. er is and power<br /> in a depression and a depression where people are afraid of it this time<br /> but the next decade actually looks like<br /> and you’re gonna live there it’s not decide john saccharine is a design credit and detractors<br /> yeah i declared a public that the future of the word future as an old carrot top<br /> and a word future will soon get a lot of use<br /> i’m inclined to agree with that guy actually i’m not sure that the word future gazette of years<br /> and obviously we have some kind of absolute future i mean we’re not going to go<br /> back to the year nineteen fifty the clock is ticking the pages i got a follow up the calendar<br /> now in a decade it’s been a b. twenty nine team will be ten years older you be tenders all of these are all solid things that’s more like<br /> cometh as the future a structure of the future or a belief in the future<br /> this is not the same minutes as not being attacked from the same area at all it’s being attacked from a different kind of area<br /> ah i know it’s i call a temper relative and i’m still workin’ on this<br /> and on not quite prepared to do a big pitch on the temple relegate<br /> wade gibson’s big fan of that says we’re at a book right now called sear our history<br /> then i had had a molly gover a temper relegate that is gonna take us a while to work on the s. b. a. type or alley<br /> you wanted a bumper sticker it’s like stain congress metaphysics<br /> and that’s a very author leafing to do as other like a super kind of culture critics saying<br /> in a few on a help me you’re like a theory jaya literary giant parade nadel<br /> cindy mail that’s now and i talked about here on my watch like about the next decade and some of what comes after year event<br /> u. s. can i feel like to live to the next ten years i had this not feel like progress<br /> however it does not feel like conservatives and you are<br /> as nina progress in our conservatism is a set of not nothing left to conserve<br /> and no direction in which to progress so what you did as transition<br /> transition to nowhere as they were khaled in the eastern bloc transition of nowhere varied<br /> common experience at eastern european states no big boom bubbles we might have wanted on expects to them<br /> at the time i had our fill of those bad weather really a given<br /> bad weather happening much faster than we expected until opal emergent change<br /> sinatra described a futurist quadrant for the twenty teams<br /> except i i really thought it futurists clot and i would not go into a strategic forecasted quandary because<br /> but such futurists call themselves and are now longer allowed to be futurists are leery of strategic forecasters<br /> there’s like just to teach it forecasted clot or mirza the dividing the future of and a four<br /> interest groups for possible worlds number one o’clock or number line crisis capitalism for aging baby boomers<br /> yes a lot of seven next decade<br /> boomers are getting all the kind of people that all of their not major actors but they’ve got all of us<br /> so then i get a get out of the way but i become more and more incapable incentive more and more<br /> attached to crotchety

temperament of this parallel here now<br /> and i guess got a good two words summer a dark euphoria<br /> our euphoria is what the twenty teams feels life<br /> things are just a falling apart you can believe the possibilities but anything is possible but you never realized or in half that<br /> to read it so much that slide i kind of<br /> the lead and the and now on record as a falling<br /> toward earth that at nine hundred kilometers an hour and then you realize there’s like no words there<br /> that’s a dark euphoria feeling that at some of the cultural temperamental but of the coming

midair and everybody die elijah can see the guy rehearsing his ability to<br /> conveying news of this kind year after year<br /> after year is going to be really good out out these are not the high tech figures that<br /> people who positioned themselves in the narrative rather than building a new permanent infrastructure<br /> that’s achieved and telling each other to do all day that’s why you love these guys<br /> they’re positioning themselves in the narrative rather than building in a permanent infrastructure<br /> their cheerleaders they’re not all there is<br /> the cheerleaders and if the marinate it happen narrative have to be poverty floods here crashes<br /> drug addiction infidelity one ever are going to be good day gal<br /> i was like death and so did j. next temperament really been wired genetics golf’s<br /> where they tossed around in a way to please the next<br /> but i may like to dress up like dead people that’s their temperament<br /> i mean when you’re a young gawky dress up like a dead person because that’s something grown ups though i am<br /> but if you’re an adult jem exner and you’re dressed up as a gough it’s like it<br /> don’t blame me because i’m

as she can<br /> what is of a alicia’s for bayliss sheik is when you have lost everything material<br /> everything you build it everything you had that you’re still wired to dig hills<br /> and really begun to baseball<br /> that’s what they allege she had lost everything you have no money you have no career yet no health insurance<br /> not even sure where you really have to have children and have no steady relationship for a new set of dependable friends and it’s hot<br /> that’s a really cool all places to be it<br /> my space as a folk bailout never been a brazilian of a lot of basically politically<br /> represents the structure of mize that you got this remote to stand<br /> brazil’s school brazilian tyrant in the democratic<br /> we get local taste no attention to use supposedly owns the whole show but the whole ship banner’s going south and a hurry<br /> it’s been out competed by some other economy this time and not been happening there<br /> yet no civil rights and my space to go anywhere my space can organize and my space<br /> you can make money in my space you can have a hot and my space<br /> and you live in a hide until they’ve pulled the pla that’s a thought they allow its made a very strong doubles<br /> of avail as an emergent structure it’s made out of corrugated tin and then briese blah<br /> so every slogan you have here practically every slogan<br /> that’s perfectly enough of a lot action is cheaper than control<br /> that’s up from bayliss slowed its cheaper to just build a high then move into ad that has to like try and lights in the utility of<br /> or did standoff just fighting duet<br /> that’s a firm bayliss slowed and sell fix it up the phone veil a slogan always invade at<br /> of course if avail as always and i don’t<br

politically it’s a slob<br /> that’s a skull well at risk well at as a brazilian high rise with a bill to internal structure<br /> but they never managed to put any utilities or a wall on it<br /> and if i see through building that’s pretty easy to just throw off eckard arisen and on the cement park<br /> and i somehow maready the stories high as forty stories high that does happen though no scanned<br /> and people squat ago and there with the breeze blacks in a corrugated<br /> and i’m there and i highrise available this will lead or a stuffed animal<br /> which is the european equivalent very big on stuffed animals here this building is a stock and<br /> it’s not a place where people like overturned society and throw it on a<br /> sear this is like some kind of smokestack industry and somebody was in here like makin’ big stuff<br /> barney coli in old red deer or whatever the building’s been re purpose<br /> as like an extinct dam like giant owada a european or rocks<br /> and i still got the height and the hose in the big glass eyes and you come in here and use that on your stack of all<br /> european designer chairs which vanished without a trace us and as you leave the building<br /> this is a stuffed animal that’s not an accident that you live in stuffed animals that you needed stopped him<br /> it’s this is what the next ten years of your life would slide<br /> you like stuffed animals stuffed animals of icarus of your generation but they’re also your frontier<br /> it’s the place rather like not pay and attention<br /> like a civilized glop you get a lot done in a stuffed animal there isn’t any other place the galley and you’re wrong<br /> there’s any other place to go on the planet the unsustainable as the only frontier you have<br /> the wreckage of the unsustainable that’s your heritage and harry out<br /> if dalton there were there in an all news structure it’s a steam powered appropriation<br /> there’s your staying the chimney out there it’s in our urban intervention<br /> a surprise to not planning to nato gardens here i don’t know why you want a black tomato gardens<br /> if you never actually been gardeners and their lives even know that this is hard dirty patient work<br /> urban aquaculture not for you know<br /> cellphone soften up her writings led by conservatives that’s that’s where your line of work<br /> so on and i want to give you some practical advice or as i know it’s like<br /> if the mayor of brandon on a novelist you know i i’m occasion i do practical things when absolutely forced to do what<br /> i i’ve i shaved abide matter webb’s hundred hours from now when i i did<br /> you started it and i don’t do it now<br /> tom side i want to give you some good advice practical advice on environmentalism<br /> and specifically he friendly criterion environmentalism<br /> does that’s one of your biggest problems we didn’t do it yourself<br /> no you’re inheriting a hundred years of atmosphere attributes that that’s not gonna get chapa hawke<br /> and after and successors to worry about the gal on akio a general principle here<br /> and for adopting generation like yours this is going to be painful for you know and really kind of a cognitive<br /> all set stop accion did<br /> now you thank that acting did as a virtue<br /> does a candidate trying to behave as if you’re a dad for a lifetime and actually appeals are temperament as a generation<br /> and it’s kind of year default position really but to have to stop that<br /> because hair shirt terrain which is i know most of the things that you have an erection list their fair share green<br /> just changes the polarity of the twentieth century as just the opposite of consumer calls<br /> to us like satanism for computer and for consumer culture in and all saying this or actually christians<br /> it’s not really a different way to lead<br /> but it’s not going to star in to fulfill it or not you know if you’re acting it well there’s a test with us<br /> that’s the great grandfather principle<br /> you’re saying i’m going to do some day it really morally worthwhile goal may be still proud of myself<br /> but does your dad great grandfather do a better job of it than you know<br /> for instance saving water put a water is indestructible<br /> first of all you cannot possibly damaged water unless you turn in the hydrogen and oxygen and just<br /> spontaneously region by searcher trying to save water because you know you’d call to save water alright<br /> you’re dead or a grandfather is saving more water than you know you cannot possibly say it any more water<br /> in a dead guy he’s greener than you know when that regard<br /> sated electrical power occasionally using less power power spaniel or foot<br /> predicated grandfather is not using any electrical power is much cleaner than you you cannot compete with that<br /> jim i think a smaller apartment here<br /> grandfather’s in a very very small part of its underground there’s no lighting there’s no heating<br /> it doesn’t have any broad band or recycling out<br /> a recycling is useful in some ways your grandfather’s literally be a recycled<br /> you can actually out recycle your day and a grandfather<br /> and furthermore and a pretty short amount of time compared lowlands of the problems are tackling didn’t the debt<br /> like your grandfather debbie’s saving every day at that point<br /> then you might be alive seventy eighty ninety years you to be dead for hundreds of millions of years<br /> millions of years of saving water billions of years of you know having a light carbons put prayer<br /> dubs carbons seaquest ration duffel a car and they buried you<br /> so i need to do things that you can do while alive<br /> i do think he can do while alive but her grandfather’s doing a better job at it you can<br /> but that aside for later when your dad like kal<br /> you know and explain how it is it you can go about doing this in a really is a different material wales<br /> life in any in the twentieth century<br /> and it’s it’s set up in the friendly approach to consumption and it’s about<br /> objects and services that are especially objects devices and i think your time<br /> berman is actually quite close to this and this is an area where i think you can do a lot of good work and ways it your grandfather in<br /> did grant great grandfather could not have time for people if you’re a generation and then especially for your children<br /> objects are pronounced the really best
